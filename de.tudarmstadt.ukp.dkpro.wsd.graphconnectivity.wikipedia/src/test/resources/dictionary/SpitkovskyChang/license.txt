This data set accompanies

   Valentin I. Spitkovsky and Angel X. Chang. 2012.
   A Cross-Lingual Dictionary for English Wikipedia Concepts.
   In Proceedings of the Eighth International
     Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012).

Please cite the appropriate publication if you use this data.  (See
  http://nlp.stanford.edu/publications.shtml for .bib entries.)


There are six line-based (and two other) text files, each of them
lexicographically sorted, encoded with UTF-8, and compressed using
bzip2 (-9).  One way to view the data without fully expanding it
first is with the bzcat command, e.g.,

  bzcat dictionary.bz2 | grep ... | less


Note that raw data were gathered from heterogeneous sources, at
different points in time, and are thus sometimes contradictory.
We made a best effort at reconciling the information, but likely
also introduced some bugs of our own, so be prepared to write
fault-tolerant code...  keep in mind that even tiny error rates
translate into millions of exceptions, over billions of datums.


Primary Files
=============

- dictionary.bz2: the dictionary for mapping words to concepts

    line format: <string><tab><cprob><space><url>[<space><score>]*

  <string> is the text to be looked up, may be empty,
    and could contain internal white-space;

  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<url> is the corresponding article,
    which may represent an entire cluster of Wikipedia pages;

  <cprob> is a conditional probability of <url> given <string>,
    computed as the sum of the numerators of W, Wx, w and w'
    divided by the sum of their denominators (see below);

  the optional sequence of space-separated scores may contain
  three types of <score> -- rational, integer and boolean:

    rationals: <label><colon><numerator><colon><denominator>
      - the W <label> states that out of a total of <denominator>
          external (non-Wikipedia) web links into the article's
          (English) cluster, <numerator> had hyper-text <string>;
      - the Wx <label> is similar, but for links into articles
          in other languages that are parallel to ones in English;
      - the w <label> is analogous, for inter-English-Wikipedia
          links, based on data from several older Wikipedia dumps;
      - and w' is another estimate of w, based on a recent crawl.

      - dl expresses that this anchor was the <numerator>th
          link (out of a total of <denominator> hyper-links)
          in a line of text of a Wikipedia disambiguation page;
      - dt is analogous, but measured in numbers of tokens.

    integers: <label><colon><count>
      - ds states that a line in the disambiguation page from
          which the link was extracted started with <count> stars;
      - dc is also analogous (to dt), but measured in characters,
          i.e., the link's position in a line (after any stars).

    booleans: <label>
      - D indicates that at least one article in the cluster
          represented by <url> is a disambiguation page;
      - l -- analogous, but is a list-of-... page;
      - m -- also analogous, but is a meanings-of-... page;
      - L, if <url> itself is a list-if-... page;
      - M, if <url> itself is a meanings-of-... page.

      - KB indicates that <url> is in the knowledge-base
          associated with the 2009-11 TAC-KBP EL/SF tasks;
      - W08 -- one of the cluster's articles is known
          from a 2008 Wikipedia dump;
      - W09 -- a 2009 Wikipedia dump;
      - WDB -- a DBpedia dump;
      - UNK is for unknown <url> values (very rare).

      - RWB indicates that <url> redirects on the web;
      - R08 states that it was a redirect in the 2008 dump;
      - R09 -- in the 2009 dump;
      - RDB -- in the DBpedia dump;
      - NR states that even though a redirecting representative
          <url> was chosen, there is at least one non-redirect in
          its cluster (which was dispreferred for other reasons).

      - CHRON:CENTURY indicates that an article is about a century;
      - CHRON:DATE -- about a date;
      - CHRON:DECADE -- decade;
      - CHRON:MILLENIUM -- millennium (oops);
      - CHRON:YEAR -- year.

      - c is for clarification: either <string> or <string>_(...)
          is the (English) title of some page in the cluster;
      - f -- another clarification: ..._(<string>) is the title;
      - t -- if <string> itself is the title.

      - h is for hash: there exists a(n English) link of the form
          ...#<string> into one of the pages in <url>'s cluster;
      - H indicates the existence of the actual internal anchor;
      - r -- a(n English) page with title <string>
          redirects into this cluster.

      - d -- a(n English) disambiguation page with title <string>
          links to some page in the cluster represented by <url>;
      - p is also on if d was signaled by the noisy WDB resource.

      - x, for cross, indicates that <string> was obtained from
         non-English data (and would differ from Wx>0 if we had
         also mined non-English titles, etc.).

- inv.dict.bz2: the inverse dictionary, for mapping concepts to words

    line format: <url><tab><cprob><space><string>[<tab><score>[<space><score>]*]

  ... as above, but now with conditional probabilities going the other way.


Secondary Files
===============

- lnrm.forw.bz2: the normalized versions of each <string>

    line format: <string><tab><lnrm>

- lnrm.back.bz2: the reverse mapping

    not-quite line-based format: <star><space><lnrm>\n[<string>\n]+\n

- lnrm.dict.bz2: a collapsed version of the forward dictionary

    format: same as in dictionary.bz2 (now aggregated by LNRM forms)

- cross.map.bz2: the cross-mapper

    format: <non-English-Wikipedia-url><tab><url>

- redir.map.bz2: the remapper

    format: <non-canonical-English-url><tab><url>[<space><score>]*

- redir.log.bz2: the remapper's trace

    ... not at all line-based; records all proposed and accepted
    merges of various English Wikipedia URLs into canonical
    forms, henceforth representing entire clusters.


Enjoy!
